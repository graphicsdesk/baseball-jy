            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  When looking back on his baseball career, senior pitcher James Vaughn realized that he “never played with that many Black kids” after playing with his inaugural team in the Harlem Little League.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “The older I got, the whiter it got, the more foreign it got,” Vaughn said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Growing up in the city, Vaughn’s parents enrolled him in private school from kindergarten to twelfth grade. He was the only Black child in his kindergarten class. However, the year before enrolling, Vaughn’s father signed him up for Harlem Little League; he competed at Jackie Robinson Park, just 30 blocks north of Columbia’s Morningside campus. The league consisted of “Black and brown kids” from Harlem, just like himself.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  At the age of 17, Vaughn made the transition to a “traditional” travel team in US Elite Baseball after spending time with a couple of city-based programs. The decision resulted in a huge culture shock for the New York City native.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “I honestly did not like it. It was all a bunch of white southern teammates from Virginia, North Carolina. I had a teammate use the N-word a few times,” Vaughn said. “There was a whole lot of stuff about the ‘right way to play baseball.’ It was just super weird to me.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “I felt a little bit out of place,” he added.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Vaughn’s current teammate, first-year pitcher Justin Bowman, had a similar experience growing up in the suburbs of Atlanta. Bowman first started playing baseball recreationally, where there was “a lot of opportunity for different backgrounds and people to play.” But once he moved to the travel team circuit around middle school, Bowman realized why there were only ever a few other people of color playing alongside him.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “I feel like that has to do a lot with the accessibility of travel ball, because nowadays you can’t just sign up for a travel ball team and play at all these different places. You have to pay a certain amount of money to be able to play on these teams and go to all these tournaments and get exposure,” Bowman said. “Kids who aren’t as fortunate, and we often see that as people of color … it’s harder for them to be on those travel teams.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  <b>‘An absolutely whiter sport’</b>
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Vaughn and Bowman’s experiences extend beyond travel baseball to the landscape of professional competitive baseball at large. In 2023, the MLB had its smallest percentage of Black players—6.1 percent—since 1955, the year before Jackie Robinson’s retirement and two decades after Manuel Rivero became Columbia’s first Black baseball player and pitcher. Such disparities are directly reflected at the collegiate level, where, excluding historically Black colleges and universities, only 4 percent of athletes on Division I rosters are Black.

            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The numbers only become more daunting when viewing official 2024 rosters from Ivy League programs, which reveal that only nine of the over 300 Ancient Eight baseball players are Black.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  This massive decrease in Black players reaching the collegiate level and beyond stems from a lack of Black youth playing the sport to begin with.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  According to Frank Guridy, professor of history at Columbia who specializes in sport history, the decline of Black participation in baseball can primarily be attributed to the lack of interest among youth in baseball as a spectator sport and the MLB’s disregard for marketing baseball to young audiences of color.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “Part of it is just about the rise of football and the rise of other sports that became more attractive to young Black male players,” Guridy said. “Baseball leadership … definitely made a concerted effort to make sure they catered to a Gen X at the youngest, maybe millennial, white fanbase. They don’t market to young people of color.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Along with baseball’s general long-term decline in popularity beginning with the rise of football in the ’60s and ’70s, Guridy emphasized an additional factor that has resulted in the decline of Black American youth participation in baseball: the suburbanization of the sport.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “In general, baseball is a much more suburbanized sport. It’s a whiter sport, it is an absolutely whiter sport than it was when I was growing up,” Guridy said. “Unless you’re somebody who’s got some connection to the game, who comes from a family that somehow played baseball for a while … baseball is not attracting urban kids.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  <b>‘The Black Aces’</b>
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The decline of Black American players throughout baseball’s history coincides with the disappearance of Black players holding one of the most important positions on the field—the pitcher. At the MLB level, the stark decline in the number of Black pitchers has been noted through a lack of new members in the “Black Aces.” “Black Aces” was a term coined by legendary Black pitcher Mudcat Grant, who applied it to Black pitchers who won at least 20 games in a single season.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  While Grant was not the first member of this club, which features other notable members like Hall of Fame pitchers Ferguson Jenkins and Bob Gibson, he helped to formalize the group to encourage the development of future Black players. The most recent member to join this esteemed collective was David Price in 2012.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Only 15 pitchers are members of the “Black Aces”—despite the fact that the MLB has been racially integrated for 76 years. Guridy pins a shortcoming of this project on the lack of recognition toward Afro-Caribbean pitchers of that era.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  One such player, Luis Tiant, an Afro-Cuban pitcher, put forth one of the most triumphant pitching seasons in major league history. In 1968, the Hall of Famer pitched nine shutouts with a 1.60 ERA to post a 21-win season.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “He suffered racial discrimination in this country and in Cuba like everybody else. So there is a Black Latino element of the story that hasn’t gotten recognized,” Guridy said. “That’s also because many of these players don’t identify with Black, African American sentiments, legible to a U.S. public. So you do have Black-Latino or Afro-Latin American players, but their experience of discrimination is different.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Although the lack of Black pitchers with this distinction can be attributed to the already declining number of African Americans in the major leagues altogether, there is also a racial stigma that comes with the position, similar to that of the quarterback position in the NFL. Just as Black quarterbacks—like two-time NFL MVP Lamar Jackson—are questioned about their throwing ability and leadership but praised for their athleticism, a similar imbalance exists for Black pitchers.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  <b>‘Under a microscope’</b>
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Black pitchers who possess immense throwing ability have historically been pushed to either the shortstop position or away from the base positions altogether due to coaching staff or scouts perceiving that they do not have the intellect for the pitching position, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/09/29/black-aces-baseball/">according to the Washington Post.</a> Even if certain Black players overcome this stigma and continue to pitch, they are met with persistent questioning of their ability as a result, only adding more pressure to a position that already has its own unique burdens.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “As a pitcher in general, you do feel a lot of pressure as to doing the right thing in certain situations outside of throwing the ball 60 feet, six inches.” Bowman said. “Paying attention to detail of the small things … just really puts you in a position to be able to succeed, and I feel like that’s especially important with persons of color because there’s not a lot of them and if you want to represent your brand then you kind of have to be on point.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  As being a Black pitcher comes with its own unique pressures and challenges, Vaughn reached out to Bowman once the Atlanta native committed to Columbia and has been there for him ever since. Vaughn helped provide reassurance to the first-year that not many on their team could provide through their shared experience with racial identity.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “There’s something different about it that I’m not really sure I can fully put into words about when you get a chance to just sit and talk with your Black teammates about just life and perseverance,” Vaughn said. “There’s definitely a shared unspoken sense of understanding. You don’t have to necessarily set any rules at the beginning or feel someone out. You know more what they’re about than your other teammates.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The two have developed a bond that has garnered Vaughn the nickname “Unc” from Bowman and helped the first-year adjust to the demands of collegiate baseball at an Ivy League institution. Vaughn invited Bowman to Black Student Athlete Alliance meetings once he got to campus and would often reach out to show Bowman he was there if needed.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “Coming into college, it’s really different from high school because you’re obviously playing with kids that are two to three years older than you and I kind of see them as mentors,” Bowman said. “He’s just like that dude that’s always been there for me.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Having these connections on a team matters—for Jordan Chriss, CC ’20, his experience was much different at Columbia as a result. Growing up in California, Chriss was introduced to baseball through his father, Reggie, who played semi-professionally as a pitcher.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  After a successful high school career at De La Salle High School—including a North Coast Section Championship in 2016—Chriss joined the Columbia baseball squad as the only Black pitcher on the roster, with two other Black players at the outfield positions. For his third and final collegiate season, Chriss was the only Black player.

  During his sophomore season, the 6-foot-3 pitcher only allowed one run with five strikeouts in the first seven innings of the 2018 Ivy League-clinching game against Yale. But Chriss explained how at the time “winning heals everything, but you know, it probably shouldn’t.”

            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “I think we are definitely looked at … under a microscope, just with societal norms of how people view Black people. You can’t swing your glove, it’s viewed differently than if a white person slams their glove,” Chriss said. “Body language is huge out there and so you gotta be like, ‘Yeah, you guys are all looking at me because I’m different and I went through a different battle to get here and you’re gonna … watch me put on a show.’”

  Pitching coaches have immense power in choosing which of the more than a dozen pitchers will get to play and at what frequency. A coach’s decision can either bolster a player’s confidence or diminish all the prior work they established, regardless of a racial bias. After playing a major part in granting Columbia its eighth Ancient Eight title in 2018, Chriss found himself fighting for a spot in the 2019 season after starting 10 games the season prior with 37 strikeouts to show for it.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “I, from a spectator perspective, can totally see how being a black pitcher, especially as one of the only ones on the field, like just visually—a lot more pressure,” Chriss said. “You could slump your shoulders down a little bit and then you might not play for three weeks because there’s so many people waiting to take your spot again.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Chriss’ senior season was canceled due to COVID-19. But while his teammates went off to compete at different schools for their last year of eligibility, the California native was done with the sport after his experience with baseball and the frustrations that came with it. While he knew a career at the professional level “wasn’t my primary goal,” Chriss’ collegiate career ended a year sooner than it could have for a pitcher of his prowess.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “Sometimes you go out there and … you’re like, ‘Nobody can touch me’ and then other times … you feel those eyes,” Chriss said. “And then I didn’t get a next time for a while, and that kind of took a toll on me.”

  <b>‘A reimagination of baseball’s identity’</b>
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Retrospectively, Chriss is still happy to have chosen Columbia for baseball and his college experience overall. Still, the early end of his career brings up the value of having teammates that you can relate to as a Black player. Without players that you can relate to, it isolates players in a sport that is based on camaraderie and teamwork.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “You’re gonna deal with it no matter what you do,” Chriss said. “But kind of being a pitcher, being on an island, definitely highlights it.”
</p>

  Guridy does not believe that a rise in African American youth participation will occur—as a lifelong fan of the sport himself. While the MLB has already put in place measures such as the Reviving Baseball in Inner City Communities program to help disadvantaged communities get into baseball, he believes there needs to be not only more of these programs but something much deeper for a substantial rise of Black players to truly be had.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “There needs to be a whole reemphasis on the deep roots that the game has in Black and Caribbean cultures. There’s just no cultural literacy on that whatsoever,” Guridy said. “The media showcasing certain Black and brown commentators, more of them and then also the clubs themselves. … More of the things that they’ve done, but a reimagination of baseball’s identity. It just has to happen.”
